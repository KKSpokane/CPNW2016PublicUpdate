                            <p>Educational programs may request an account once an affiliation agreement with a CPNW
                            affiliated healthcare facility is in place.   To request an account complete the form below as instructed and click submit. CPNW Technical Support will create your schools account and contact you to schedule account management training. Please allow 48 hours to receive a response to your application.
                            </p>

                            <p>Schools are required to have two individuals assigned to serve as coordinators to manage student accounts. These individuals will be responsible for instructing students on how to create and manage their accounts as well as verify students have completed their
                                onboarding requirements. Detailed account creation and coordinator responsibility information will be provided during training.</p>

                            <p> There is an annual fee for student users based on the level of service.  The fee is collected during the account creation
                            process. Faculty who teach at a member clinical site must complete the same requirements as
                            students, however, CPNW does not charge clinical faculty a user fee. Schools are not assessed a subscriber fee.
